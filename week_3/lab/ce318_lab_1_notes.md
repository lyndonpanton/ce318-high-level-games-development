# CE318 Lab 1 Notes

- For directional light, position is not important as it effects all objects
equally
When nesting similar game objects in a parent, it is important to reset the
parent's position before nesting the game objects, otherwise the children's
- position will be relative to the parent's position, not the origin (0, 0, 0)
