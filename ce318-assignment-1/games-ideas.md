# Game Ideas

## Introduction

Since I was struggling to find a good game idea that I would like to create
(excluding what I already decided to create for my CE301 Individual Capstone 
Project Challenge), I used the internet and my own head to give me some
inspiration on what to create and what art style to use

## Game Inspiration

## Decision

Game: I would like to make a crafting / simulation game
Art: The game should use low poly or geometric art
